title: "Remote Development Environments: a White Paper"
excerpt: When we were approached by a client to look into remote development environments, we were excited. This up-and-coming approach — which involves developers using a local IDE to code in the company cloud — has a lot of potential. Not only does it give developers access to the power of corporate datacentres, but it also does so without compromising developer experience.

## Remote Development Environments

We spent several months investigating the benefits and drawbacks of the approach, comparing them with other approaches, and producing concise requirements. We explore the related (and often contrasting) themes of security and developer experience, and provide a set of situational comparisons to help you choose which paradigm is right for your organisation.

Maybe just giving each developer a laptop will allow them to work most effectively, at the cost of a lot of security and compatibility worries? Perhaps Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) is the answer to provide homogeneity of environment without compromising security? Or maybe you can provide that consistency while still allowing your developers to work with the tools they choose, on whichever machine they like -- using a remote development environment!

Our white paper covers all these questions, structured to allow to you to dip in and out to get the information you need as effectively as possible. It provides background on both Developer Experience and different kinds of security concerns, and compares three paradigms:

- Providing each developer with a laptop on which they should do their coding
- Using Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) to provide a consistent, secure environment in the corporate cloud
- Creating Remote Desktop Environments (RDEs) on-demand to allow flexibility and scalability without compromising on security or consistency

We include a set of scenarios allowing you to compare the pros and cons of each paradigm. Should you choose RDEs, we also provide a set of sample requirements to help with procurement processes.
