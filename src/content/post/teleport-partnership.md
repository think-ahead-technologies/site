## Introducing the New Teleport Policy Features

Teleport has recently introduced powerful new policy features aimed at unifying and controlling access policies across your entire infrastructure. These features provide significant advantages, such as:

-   **Unified Policy Management**: Teleport allows you to manage access policies centrally, eliminating the need for esoteric languages and numerous file formats. This streamlines policy management across AWS, Azure, GCP, on-premises, services, and custom applications[^1][^2].
-   **Access Graph**: This feature provides a visual representation of the relationships between users, roles, and resources, allowing you to gain comprehensive visibility into access paths and quickly answer questions about who can access specific resources[^3].
-   **Fine-Grained Access Controls**: Implement just-in-time access, define specific access controls tailored to roles, and automate compliance with industry standards such as SOC 2 and FedRAMP[^4].
-   **Enhanced Security Posture**: Identify and replace standing or stale privileges and over-permissive roles to harden your security against potential breaches. The Access Graph also allows for rapid investigation and response to security incidents[^2][^5].
